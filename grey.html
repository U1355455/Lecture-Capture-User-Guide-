           <h1>Lecture Capture - User Guide</h1>   
          <h3>Learn how to use tools & features within Lecture Capture!</h3>
          <p>Lecture Capture is an upcoming software that is being introduced within Higher Education. The University of Huddersfield has recently introduced the software campus wide and this user guide explains everything you need to know to use the software effectively to get the best from it.</p>
                <button class="accordion">What is Lecture Capture?</button>
<div class="panel">
                <b>What is Lecture Capture?</b><p>The software uses audio-visual equipment to capture the contents of the lecture as it is taking place. The AV equipment makes it possible to record both sound and image within a lecture, it may be that the whole lecture is recorded or just the screen, depending on the preference of the lecturer.</p><p>The service provider for the University of Huddersfield is Panopto so please don’t be confused if you see this mentioned around campus, although the software should always be branded as HudStream.</p>

<button class="accordion">What can Lecture Capture be used for?</button>
<div class="panel">
         <b>What can Lecture Capture be used for?</b><p>Lecture Capture recordings are useful to go over the content that has been mentioned in a lecture again. It may be that the academic has gone over the information quickly and the student missed an important aspect within the lecture. It could be that a student has a valid reason to not attend a lecture such as ill health, Lecture Capture can insure that the student won’t miss the content of a lecture if they were unable to attend. It is possible that a student struggles to engage in a lecture and take notes at the same time they may find it useful to watch the recording later and take notes from the recording so that they are able to fully engage in the session.</p>

<button class="accordion">Further Information:</button>
<div class="panel">
                <b>When is the Lecture Capture recording available?</b>
              <p>The Lecture Capture recording will be made available to students 48 hours after the lecture has taken place, this allows the lecturer to edit the recording or make any changes, include notes etc. If there are no changes to be made to the recording then it may be that it is made available immediately. Students can then visit the capture as many times as they wish.</p>
              <b>What devices can the videos be accessed on?</b>
              <p>The Lecture Capture videos are compatible with all devices, which means that students can use their PC, Laptop, Smartphone or Tablet to watch the videos. The videos are streamed rather than downloaded, which means the device will either use Wi-Fi or a data plan.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How can Lecture Capture be accessed?</button>
<div class="panel">
                <b>How can Lecture Capture be accessed?</b>
                <p>Once the capture is uploaded there are two ways in which a student can access the Lecture Capture recordings. Either through UniLearn or by directly logging into HudStream.</p>
              <a href="https://unilearn.hud.ac.uk/">UniLearn</a>
              <p>Lecture Capture can be accessed through UniLearn, once logged into Lecture Capture recording for each module can be found under each module tab. The videos will be stored within the folder in each module in date order.</p>

<div class="panel">
                <b>Contents:</b>

    <b>Discussion</b><p>The discussion tool can be used by all joined to the module, this can be useful if you need to ask your lecturer something you know will be useful to fellow students or you would like the opinion of your fellow students. Please note if you have an important question it may be better to contact the lecturer directly as this tool may not be something they check regularly.</p>
